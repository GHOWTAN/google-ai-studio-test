Here is "RPS Riot".

This is a "weird" take on Rock Paper Scissors. It is an ecosystem simulation.

Grey = Rock

White = Paper

Red = Scissors

How to Play:

Arrow Keys: Move the Crosshair.

Z Key: Spawn a random unit at the crosshair to disrupt the balance.

Goal: Watch them fight! Use your crosshair to save a dying species or force a specific color to win. If one color takes over the whole screen, the game resets with more units!




Here is "STONK PANIC".

It simulates a highly volatile, nonsensical stock market.

How to Play:

Z Key: BUY (Turn cash into stocks)

X Key: SELL (Turn stocks into cash)

Goal: Buy Low, Sell High. Don't go broke ($0).

The Weird Part: The market reacts to "News" that makes no sense (e.g., "CLOUDS ARE ILLEGAL").



This is "NEON VOID DRIFTER".

It is an abstract survival game focused on fluid movement and visual aesthetics.

The "Artist Style" Approach: Instead of clearing the screen completely every frame, this game draws a semi-transparent black layer over the previous frame. This creates permanent "trails" and motion blur for all objects, giving it a dreamy, phosphorescent look.

How to Play:

Left / Right Arrows: Rotate your drifter.

Up Arrow: Thrust forward (momentum based).

Goal: Survive. Avoid the incoming geometric "Data Shards". The longer you survive, the faster the music of the cosmos becomes.
